## what's new

### As of Jan 27

Files and folders are updated.

1. docs/ contains
   - our `.md` files that you should _probably (definitely)_ look at

2. JavaScript/ contains
   - ~~extension sample code (Lab 1)~~
   - three working examples of where to `JavaScript-in-HTML`

3. processing/ contains
   - p5js/
     - stand-alone local browser example
   - python-mode/
     - python version of supplied p5js example

4. misc/ contains
   - some additional `txt` files for installation help (incomplete for all `OS` but will be updated when and if we need to)
   - an `img` folder to collect found content (don't worry if it's important it won't stay in the misc folder)
   - weekly updates otherwise not found in `docs/`
     - (where those `.md` files that _you should probably look at_ reside)

5. demos/ contains
   - extension sample code (Lab 1)
     - with `HTML`
     - with `HTML` _and_ `JavaScript`

### Old (and maybe no longer relevant)

- live content will be cleaned, edited, and described in logfile and code comments each week
- don't worry about the GitHub CLI (command line interface) files.. we will look at git and/or gh during Week 2
- it's there if you're interested though
